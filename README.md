# Philosophers 🍽️

## Overview

The Philosophers project is a coding challenge at 42 that simulates the classic dining philosophers problem. The goal is to create a program that demonstrates the concepts of concurrency and synchronization among multiple processes. 🧠✨

## Objectives

- Implement a solution for the dining philosophers problem using threads or processes. 🔄
- Ensure that philosophers can eat without causing deadlock or starvation. 🚫🍽️
- Use proper synchronization mechanisms (e.g., mutexes, semaphores) to manage resource access. 🔒

## Requirements

- Each philosopher must think and eat alternately. 💭🍴
- A philosopher can only eat if both forks (resources) are available. 🍴🍴
- Implement a mechanism to prevent deadlock and ensure fair access to resources. ⚖️

## Setup

To get started with the Philosophers project, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HoudaChairi/Philo.git
cd Philo
```
